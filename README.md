# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to provide a place of knowledge to other bootcamp students to help with the prework. I built this project so students taking the bootcamp have notes that I took and found useful during my prework to help with their prework that they could easily access on a webpage in a neat concise way. It solves the problem of students being confused during their prework like I was, and having someone who provide study notes who once went through the same thing as them. I learned about Git, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Each section on the webpage contains notes about a certain topic which include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics from  the prework and choose one topic for you to study first.
